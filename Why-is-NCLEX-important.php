                    <p class="text-left p-0">
                    If you aim to work as a nurse in America, Australia and Canada, you will be required to take and pass the NCLEX exam. Successful completion of an NCLEX examination demonstrates to employers that nurses have a high level of ability and skill in the nursing field. Most employers require their nursing professionals to have an appropriate license to practice as nurses as it is one of the ways that those in the healthcare industry safeguard the protection of the public.

                    </p>

                    <p class="text-left p-0">
                    The material which NCLEX covers, and you need to know to pass the exam is the application of the content covered in undergraduate nursing courses.
Unlike other examinations, NCLEX is not about memorizing information for the exam. Students must have a strong grasp of the concepts involved in nursing. Critical thinking is the most important aspect of this examination as well as the nursing profession.Taking NCLEX is a vital part of a nurse's career life. Passing this test means you are highly qualified than other nursing professionals.

                        Let's read what they say…
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>UNDERSTAND THE NCLEX FORMAT</b></h4>

                    <p class="text-left p-0">

                    Understanding the test format can help you clear NCLEX and use the best of your abilities. The NCLEX uses CAT format, or computerized adaptive testing, which means that no single exam is identical. While the exam is in process, the computer will determine the succeeding questions based on the previous responses. The test bank is comprehensive and comprises various question styles and topic content.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-left p-0">
                    The test will produce a minimum of 75 questions, and a maximum of 265 questions. A candidate passes the test when they have answered enough questions correctly to stay above the pass line with a 95% confidence interval.
                    </p>
                    <h4><b>Find Ways to Manage Your Test Stress</b></h4>

                    <p class="text-left p-0">

                    Test anxiety is a real thing, and it could be a challenge for those who do not know how to manage it during the test. But do not worry, there are ways you can manage your anxiety levels.

                        <ul style="line-height: 40px;">
                            <li>  Prepare seriously. You need to be well prepared before you go for the real exam. Boost your confidence level by doing practice tests.</li>
                            <li>Keep your mind calm by balancing your studying and personal time. Do activities which help you relax.</li>
                            <li>Do not cram things. Understand a concept and its applications through examples.</li>
                            <li>On test day, relax your mind. Don't study until the last minute.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Make your study plan</b></h4>

                    <p class="text-left p-0">
                    Devise a study plan that can help you manage your time well. Set a schedule of days and hours you will study, the days you will take off and relax, and the day you will take mock tests. Making a goal will help you progress. 
                    </p>


                    <p class="text-left p-0">
                    Studying without a plan is like being a bird who does not know how to fly. Use your preparation time very well.
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Work on your weaknes</b></h4>

                    <p class="text-left p-0">
                    By taking mock tests, know your weaknesses and strengths. You can then use the feedback to work on your weaknesses to turn them into strengths. The areas you are weak in, improve them by giving them more time and effort.
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Prepare for the worst</b></h4>

                    <p class="text-left p-0">
                    It is always important to practice for the worst. No matter how well you're doing in the practice tests or getting minimal number of incorrect answers, it is only half of the ideal preparation process.
                    </p>

                    <ul style="line-height: 35px">
                        <li>You need to look up questions that you answered incorrectly. Always check explanations of each question to develop a mindset for the test.</li>
                        <li>Always note down the concepts you want to revise and get constantly wrong; these are the concepts you might be weak at. Focus on your problem areas.</li>

                    </ul>


                    <h4><b>On test day:</b></h4>

                        <li>A healthy, balanced breakfast will ensure you sustain energy and don’t get hungry.</li>
                        <li>You can re-read summaries but don’t start trying to digest a new concept or learn new material on the day of an exam.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you take everything you are permitted to have in the exam</li>

                        <li> Stay calm, you have done your homework and have nothing to fear!</li>
                        <li>If your mind goes blank during the exam, do a simple breathing exercise to focus yourself, then have a calm read of the question to find something you know well</li>
                        <li> Don’t keep re-living the exam when it’s over.</li>
