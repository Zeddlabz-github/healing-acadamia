                    <p class="text-left p-0">
                    The National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) tests your skills and knowledge acquired in nursing school to ensure that you are qualified to work in the local hospitals and other healthcare facilities in America, Canada and Australia. Passing NCLEX gives you a license that is a proof of qualification of the ability to critically apply skills gained in nursing school. NCLEX is of two categories, namely, the NCLEX-RN, which is for individuals aiming to become a registered nurse; the NCLEX-PN, which is for individuals aiming to pursue a license as a practical nurse. Any individual with a Bachelor’s in Nursing and a vision of working as a registered nurse, needs to meet the basic requirements of passing the NCLEX examination. 
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        The NCLEX examination may last up to five hours depending on the exam’s category. Any examinee who does not pass an attempt must wait 45 to 90 days before taking the examination again. <br> <br>

                    <h2 class="text-left"> Question in <span> NCLEX</span> </h2>

                    <p class="text-left px-0">
                    Although the majority of questions in NCLEX are of the type, multiple choice, there may be alternate question types including multiple-response, fill-in-the-blank, hot spots, chart/exhibit, and drag-and-drop. Healing Angels Academia’s NCLEX practice questions mimic the questions from the official exam provided by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-left px-0">
                    NCLEX questions demand you to think critically. Sometimes, there may be more than one right answer but making the most appropriate choice will demonstrate that you can think critically under pressure and make the right decisions as a practicing nurse.
                    </p>

                    <b>NCLEX questions can be of categories: </b><br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Management of Care: 17-23%</li>
                        <li>Reduction of Risk Potential: 9-15%</li>
                        <li>Basic Care and Comfort: 6-12%</li>
                        <li>Physiological Adaptation: 11-17%</li>
                    </ul>

                    Every time you answer a question, the computer revaluates the difficulty of the upcoming questions based on the correctness of all your previous responses. Your first question is relatively easy, if you answer it correctly, the computer supplies you with a more difficult question from its question bank. The test bank is comprehensive and comprises various question styles and topic content
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-left px-0">
                    The test will produce a minimum of 75 questions, and a maximum of 265 questions. A candidate passes the test when they have answered enough questions correctly to stay above the pass line with a 95% confidence interval.

                    Now you know what the NCLEX is and what to expect from the exam. But before you can set your sights on conquering the test, you must have first made it through nursing school to prepare for the test.
